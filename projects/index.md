> ### 💬 VKontakte Sentiment Analysis Tool
> 
> A Python3 library for sentiment analysis of comments from toxic and non-toxic VKontakte communities. The project addresses the gap in existing solutions by combining automated comment collection with sentiment analysis specifically optimized for highly toxic or non-toxic communities. Designed for VK community administrators and researchers who need automated sentiment monitoring.
> 
> **Key Features:**
> - Custom sentiment analysis dataset with 14,680 manually annotated comments
> - Multi-class classification (positive, negative, neutral, skip, speech) following RuSentiment guidelines
> - Automated comment collection from VK groups
> - Community-level sentiment indices (positivity/neutrality/negativity scores)
> - 192 preprocessing variants with comprehensive text normalization
> - Best configuration: 0.78 F1-score (vs. Dostoevsky baseline: 0.55 F1)
> 
> **Technologies:** Python3, scikit-learn, pymorphy2, TF-IDF, XGBoost, SGDClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, MultinomialNB
